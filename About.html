		<h4>Hello world!</h4>
		
		<em>Realistically</em>, if you've made it to my personal website, you probably know me pretty well already.<br><br>
		
		That said, the whole point of an 'about' page is to talk about who you are and why you made the site, so here goes.<br><br>
		</center>
		
		<p>
		My name is Ryan O'Flaherty, and I study Games Development at Edinburgh Napier University. Please excuse the surrounding website, as that course doesn't teach us
		web development, and so this is me purely experimenting to see what I can create at this point. I'm 22 years old [can we do some script thing that updates that 
		based on the date vs my DOB?!] and if you didn't already know that due to knowing me IRL, you've probably come from my 
		<a href ="http://www.YouTube.com/user/x4iiiis" target="_blank">YouTube page</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		My hobbies include working out in the gym, programming, gaming, and experimenting with new skills (like building this site!). My other interests are football, snooker, heavy metal
		music (although I'll listen to most genres, metal is where my heart is), and teaching myself how to make unintentionally horrible noises with an acoustic guitar. Part of me hopes
		that I'll one day have some musical ability that I can use to create my own music for personal code projects and games, as well as things like promo music for YouTube videos. Take
		that, copyright!
		</p><br>
		
		<h4>Idols and Inspirations</h4>
		<p>
		One of the main reasons I ever even considered game development was the beautiful Japanese man that is 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Kojima" target="_blank"> Hideo Kojima</a>.<br><br>
		
		Admittedly, I should not have had access to it, but from a very young age I used to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid</a>
		on an old demo-disc back in the day. For years I begged <em>Santa</em> to bring me the full version, 'cause the endless hours of luring genome soldiers around crates with footsteps and knocking noises
		was surely going to be followed up by a brilliant full game. I wasn't wrong. The original Metal Gear Solid is, to this day, one of my favourite games of all time.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In fact, years later when I bought the Metal Gear collection for the PS3 and finally got to play 2, 3, Peace Walker and 4, it was only 4 that was able to surpass it.
		I loved MGS4 all the way through it, but the return to Shadow Moses Island blew my mind. As soon as that happened, I decided that MGS4 > MGS1.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Although Kojima and I are on completely different paths - not least because Hideo is now looking into a career in film - his ability to create such a breathtaking
		story mixing real-life, serious issues with sci-fi with every Metal Gear Solid game he makes leaves me in awe. I may not be a writer or director, but any time I do
		make my own game that has a story to tell, I'll be thinking of Hideo Kojima the whole way through the process.
		</p><br>
		
		<p>
		Another huge character I look up to is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger" target="_blank"> Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>.<br><br>
		
		I first knew Arnold as the guy from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)" target="_blank"> Terminator</a> and 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten_Cop" target="_blank"> Kindergarten Cop</a> when I was growing up, but in recent years I've grown to know him as an 
		inspirational figure in the realm of bodybuilding.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		However, many of the principles he applied to his training to obtain his unbelievable Mr Olympia winning physique are things that he also applies to all other aspects
		of life as well, and he recommends that we do too to reach any of our goals in life. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Schwarzenegger has many, many inspirational speeches, videos, and articles on the internet, but I highly recommend 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyhOmBPtGNM" target="_blank">this video</a> for anyone struggling to motivate themselves, or feeling any kind of doubt about a
		personal goal in life, regardless of what that goal is. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Furthermore, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJPRj19OU-w" target="_blank">this video</a> shows the mindblowing dedication that Arnold Schwarzenegger has 
		displayed throughout his entire career and life.
		</p><br>
		
		<p>
		I find my life is largely influenced lyrically, and the front men for two of my favourite bands are exceptional wordsmiths.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Those men go by the names of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Draiman" target="_blank"> David Draiman</a> and 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_McIlrath" target="_blank"> Tim McIlrath</a>, of 		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disturbed_(band)" target="_blank"> Disturbed</a> 
		and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_Against" target="_blank"> Rise Against</a> respectively.
		</p><br>
		
		<p>
		Both bands continually address real-world, past and present political issues using their <em>music as a weapon</em>. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		One thing I particularly like about that is that they both know their views don't appeal to everyone. If people don't identify with the opinions and politics conveyed in the music,
		then those people will not buy their music. They don't care about that. They are not out there to sell out and appeal to everyone and make as much revenue as they possibly can. 
		They're there because they love what they do, and they want to spread their message, without even a second thought about being disliked or disagreed with as a result. 
		</p><br>
		
		<p>
		Another musical influence that has to be included is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park" target="_blank"> Linkin Park</a>.<br>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Tragically, their frontman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington" target="_blank"> Chester Bennington</a> ended his own life. Linkin Park
		Have released several songs with sad themes, and these tracks have helped me, and a huge fanbase around the globe to get through low points in life. Chester's ability as a lyricist
		to hit hard with <em>depressive</em> thoughts and ideas, while also uplifting the listener was truly remarkable.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Since his death, thousands of tributes have been pouring out,
		with many people admitting that Chester and Linkin Park had actually prevented them from committing suicide. Chester helped and touched an unthinkable amount of lives, but
		was unfortunately unable to defeat his own demons in the end.
		</p>
