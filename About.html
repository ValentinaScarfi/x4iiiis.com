		<h4>Hello world!</h4>
		
		<em>Realistically</em>, if you've made it to my personal website, you probably know me pretty well already.<br><br>
		
		That said, the whole point of an 'about' page is to talk about who you are and why you made the site, so here goes.<br><br>
		</center>
		
		<p>
		My name is Ryan O'Flaherty, and I study Games Development at Edinburgh Napier University. Please excuse the surrounding website, as that course doesn't teach us
		web development, and so this is me purely experimenting to see what I can create at this point. I'm <span id="age">unknown</span> years old and if you didn't 
		already know that due to knowing me IRL, you've probably come from my <a href ="http://www.YouTube.com/user/x4iiiis" target="_blank">YouTube page</a>.

		<h4>What's an 'x 4 i i i i s?'</h4>
		
		<p>
			<del>A four-eyed Scottish creature most commonly found coding, gaming, or out in the wild 
			hunting for testosterone to grow a beard.</del>
		</p>

		<p>
		The 'x' is for decoration. It's pronounced four-eyes. Get it? 'Cause I wear glasses?!
		<p>
		
		<p>
		Before I started the x4iiiis YouTube channel, I had another channel (I had a few actually) called '<a href ="http://www.YouTube.com/user/Spl1tSecond" target="_blank">Spl1tSecond</a>.'<br> 
		(If you're gonna have a peek please be gentle with your judgement, it's pretty old and one day I accidentally deleted every single video I'd uploaded, and so a lot of content was lost D;)
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Anyway...<br>
		Back then, my friend Josh and I thought it would be funny to mock ourselves in our gamertags when we changed them to something with 'Spl1t' in them, and so I became 'Spl1t 4iiiis x,'
		and he was 'Spl1t Midget x.' Midget can be seen ruining my life at the end of <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEUxzmsx-T0" target="_blank">this short video</a> from the good old days of MW2.
		<p>
		
		<p>
		At that time, I was mostly making videos for myself, but I was also uploading other stuff, such as Halo 3 montages with Midget and another two of my friends, Calum and Colin. The first ever
		montage we made can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt8Aobk3Nxg" target="_blank">here</a>. It's actually unlisted on YouTube, meaning you can only watch it if you have the link
		because it hasn't been released publicly since it was re-uploaded. I'm not entirely sure why, but it's probably something to do with the copyrighted music. I most likely only re-uploaded it so that
		the guys could see their clips again.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		We had a second Halo 3 montage that we split into three parts, but I only ever managed to recover <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1WiAYJQSMs" target="_blank">part one</a> 
		and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mrbxzvh_q-8" target="_blank">part two</a>. Again, these are unlisted, most likely due to copyright infringement. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Around the time that I started studying at university, I decided to make a fresh YouTube channel. Spl1tSecond had over 400 subscribers at the time but very few of them were active, a lot of the
		stuff on there sucked anyway, and the account had some copyright strikes so I decided that it was time to fly solo with a clean slate. My life was entering into a new chapter with university and so
		I decided that a totally new approach to YouTube should come with it. And it did! I took up doing gameplay commentaries and guides as well as showing off the odd montage clip. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		So that covers what an x4iiiis is, how to pronounce it, and where it came from. What it doesn't cover, though, is
		</p><br>
		
		<h4>Who is x4iiiis?</h4>
		
		<p>
		x4iiiis is a brown-eyed, long-sighted, bodybuilding metalhead who loves to write code, play video games, and make YouTube videos. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Let's disect that a little bit. My hobbies include working out in the gym, programming, gaming, and experimenting with new skills (like building this site!). My other interests are football, 
		snooker, heavy metal music (although I'll listen to most genres), and teaching myself how to make unintentionally horrible noises with an acoustic guitar. Part of me hopes that I'll one 
		day have some musical ability that I can use to create my own music for personal code projects and games, as well as things like promo music for YouTube videos. Take that, copyright!
		</p><br>
		
		
		<h4>Idols and Inspirations</h4>
		
		
		<p>
		One of the main reasons I ever even considered game development was the beautiful Japanese man that is 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Kojima" target="_blank"> Hideo Kojima</a>.<br><br>
		
		Admittedly, I should not have had access to it, but from a very young age I used to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid</a>
		on an old demo-disc back in the day. For years I begged <em>Santa</em> to bring me the full version, 'cause the endless hours of luring genome soldiers around crates with footsteps and knocking noises
		was surely going to be followed up by a brilliant full game. I wasn't wrong. The original Metal Gear Solid is, to this day, one of my favourite games of all time.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In fact, years later when I bought the Metal Gear collection for the PS3 and finally got to play 2, 3, Peace Walker and 4, it was only 4 that was able to surpass it.
		I loved MGS4 all the way through it, but the return to Shadow Moses Island blew my mind. As soon as that happened, I decided that MGS4 > MGS1.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Although Kojima and I are on completely different paths - not least because Hideo is now looking into a career in film - his ability to create such a breathtaking
		story mixing real-life, serious issues with sci-fi with every Metal Gear Solid game he makes leaves me in awe. I may not be a writer or director, but any time I do
		make my own game that has a story to tell, I'll be thinking of Hideo Kojima the whole way through the process.
		</p><br>
		
		<p>
		Another huge character I look up to is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger" target="_blank"> Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>.<br><br>
		
		I first knew Arnold as the guy from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)" target="_blank"> Terminator</a> and 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten_Cop" target="_blank"> Kindergarten Cop</a> when I was growing up, but in recent years I've grown to know him as an 
		inspirational figure in the realm of bodybuilding.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		However, many of the principles he applied to his training to obtain his unbelievable Mr Olympia winning physique are things that he also applies to all other aspects
		of life as well, and he recommends that we do too to reach any of our goals in life. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Schwarzenegger has many, many inspirational speeches, videos, and articles on the internet, but I highly recommend 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyhOmBPtGNM" target="_blank">this video</a> for anyone struggling to motivate themselves, or feeling any kind of doubt about a
		personal goal in life, regardless of what that goal is. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Furthermore, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJPRj19OU-w" target="_blank">this video</a> shows the mindblowing dedication that Arnold Schwarzenegger has 
		displayed throughout his entire career and life.
		</p><br>
		
		<p>
		I find my life is largely influenced lyrically, and the front men for two of my favourite bands are exceptional wordsmiths.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Those men go by the names of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Draiman" target="_blank"> David Draiman</a> and 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_McIlrath" target="_blank"> Tim McIlrath</a>, of 		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disturbed_(band)" target="_blank"> Disturbed</a> 
		and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_Against" target="_blank"> Rise Against</a> respectively.
		</p><br>
		
		<p>
		Both bands continually address real-world, past and present political issues using their <em>music as a weapon</em>. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		One thing I particularly like about that is that they both know their views don't appeal to everyone. If people don't identify with the opinions and politics conveyed in the music,
		then those people will not buy their music. They don't care about that. They are not out there to sell out and appeal to everyone and make as much revenue as they possibly can. 
		They're there because they love what they do, and they want to spread their message, without even a second thought about being disliked or disagreed with as a result. 
		</p><br>
		
		<p>
		Another musical influence that has to be included is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park" target="_blank"> Linkin Park</a>.<br>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Tragically, their frontman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington" target="_blank"> Chester Bennington</a> ended his own life. Linkin Park
		Have released several songs with sad themes, and these tracks have helped me, and a huge fanbase around the globe to get through low points in life. Chester's ability as a lyricist
		to hit hard with <em>depressive</em> thoughts and ideas, while also uplifting the listener was truly remarkable.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Since his death, thousands of tributes have been pouring out,
		with many people admitting that Chester and Linkin Park had actually prevented them from committing suicide. Chester helped and touched an unthinkable amount of lives, but
		was unfortunately unable to defeat his own demons in the end.
		</p><br>
		
		<p>
		When it comes to making YouTube videos - particularly montage type videos - there are two main videos that I look to for inspiration.<br>
		</p>
	
	<div class="video-container">
		<div class="video">
			<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hfEBtmGcM0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
		</div>
	</div>

		<p>
		First up, Dutchy's 'Halo 3 Montage 2,' or H3M2 for short.
		</p><br>
	
	<div class="video-container">
		<div class="video">
			<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbW5jJZ7NwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
		</div>
	</div>
		
		<p>
		Despite the way I see Dutchy's H3M2 to be the montage I look to for inspiration when I'm bored or looking to create something, the following was, on it's own, the video that made me buy
		a standard definition Dazzle Capture Card and start recording horrible quality clips from my Xbox 360. Kampy >>>>>>>>>>>>. 
		</p><br>

		<p>
				I like to train and fancy myself as a bit of a bodybuilder. Not the <em>"Hey look at me I'm swole as fuuuuuuaaaarrrrkkkkk"</em> kind, but I enjoy trying to continually improve my body.
				I don't think I'll ever be some huge meathead, but I do like to think I've slapped a bit of muscle on since I started.<br><br>
		
				I joined my first gym in February of 2014 (MAKING THIS UP I THINK CHECK IT PLZ) because I was not happy with my body. I'd hated my body for a long time, but I'd finally drawn the final straw.
				I was at 70kg and it felt like it was just pure fat. I felt huge. I was bursting trousers at work, and my friends had been nagging me to join the gym for about a year. So I did it. I lost a lot
				of weight, and then I decided it was time to start putting on muscle. I quickly fell in love with the pain and the gains.
		</p>

		<strong>Do you track macros?</strong><br>
		No.<br><br>

		I try to be clever about what I eat and sometimes I will use MyFitnessPal to check the macros of certain foods, but I pretty much just <em>guesstimate</em> what my macronutrients are
		each day. Aiming to eat clean and have a keep the cheat meals to a minimum (maybe once a week), I make an effort to totally avoid chocolate and drink only water most of the time. I only 
		consume alcohol occasionally - usually at social events. I avoid it because I don't like the negative after-effects it has on my body.

		<h2>Tattoo Section?</h2>
		<p>
			I only have one tattoo at the moment. It's a tribute to a friend of mine that died young. 
		</p>
			<img alt="SW TATTOO" src="images/tattoos/SWTattoo.jpg">
		<p>
			Stefan Wozniak was a good friend of mine, and despite the fact he had literally just bought a
			a new Lexus, he was already telling us his next car would be a BMW. He was obsessed with cars 
			and BMWs especially. 
			<br>
			So, when he was taken from us, I decided to get some ink. The tattoo is just a BMW badge with
			the 'M' removed and the 'B' swapped for an 'S,' giving his initials.
