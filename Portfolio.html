			If you could somehow manage to get the Chess thing from first year up and running that'd be sick,
			I know it was nothing special but just a starting point and being able to talk about how it was a 
			challenge as part of a team with Caelan sitting trying to get 99 Construction on Runescape whilst
			Calum and I try to figure out the bug in our code and Kristian watches Caelan and tells us how 
			shit and boring Runescape looks compared to World of Warcraft (not shitting on Kristian here, he 
			was a good guy. I would've liked to have seen how he'd be getting on if he was here with us this
			year. He wasn't happy with the course in first year, imagine how he would've reacted to the Ben
			fiasco)

			Add some stuff with the advanced games engineering solo project (obviously make it better than
			the shite you handed in).
		</p><br>

		<p>
			Add some more shite with the advanced games engineering project with Jeremy Malisse and Steven
			Graham.

			Brief little thing about your honours project, maybe a quick little YouTube demo and some screenshots,
