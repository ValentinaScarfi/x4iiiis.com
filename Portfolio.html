				<p>
					Given a minimalistic project solution, we were tasked with creating a shoot 'em up game using
					SFML and C++. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The timeframe was a week, and the result was pretty pish.
				</p>
		</div>

				<img alt="AGECW2" src="AGEpromo/images/Menu.png" style="width:50%;height:50%;">
				<h3><center>Advanced Games Engineering II</center></h3>
				<p>
					A poor group-working experience lead to an incomplete game that had initially showed
					good promise. I was hugely disappointed with the result, and so I took it upon myself to
					continue development in my spare time in a bid to keep the idea alive.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea was to create a shoot 'em up style game, but with a twist. That twist was that
					after a set amount of time, the game would transform into a platformer after the player
					takes on a boss. Then, at the end of the platformer would be another boss battle. 
				</p>
				<p>
					After the module, the shoot 'em up stage wasn't even completed - even without a final boss.
					It was a real mess and became a scramble to tick boxes to earn marks for the coursework rather
					than being about what we wanted the game to be.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result, a lot of work needed to be done, but here is the final result!
				</p>

			<h3><center>Giveaway Application</center></h3>
				<p>
					I'd never worked with an API, and I'd never worked with Python. Therefore, I decided 
					to work with an API using Python! 
				</p>
				<p>
					Actually, it was two APIs. I wrote (naw ye didny) an application to find out who tweeted
					a given set of keywords, or full sentence. 
				</p>
				<p>
					That way, when I decide to do a giveaway on my YouTube channel, I can tell people to get 
					creative with a set of keywords and try to make a funny sentence or tweet. Then, I'll find
					all of these tweets with my script, and enter their @handle into the prize draw! 

					<br>I'll probably automatically retweet and/or like them all too. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I also want to be able to see who has both liked and shared a facebook post announcing the
					giveaway. These people will also be entered into the draw. People with both twitter and facebook
					accounts will be able to enter the draw twice, or even more if they have multiple accounts.
				</p>
				<p>
					There's not really a lot I can do about that - but hey, it's more exposure for me :p

			If you could somehow manage to get the Chess thing from first year up and running that'd be sick,
			I know it was nothing special but just a starting point and being able to talk about how it was a 
			challenge as part of a team with Caelan sitting trying to get 99 Construction on Runescape whilst
			Calum and I try to figure out the bug in our code and Kristian watches Caelan and tells us how 
			shit and boring Runescape looks compared to World of Warcraft (not shitting on Kristian here, he 
			was a good guy. I would've liked to have seen how he'd be getting on if he was here with us this
			year. He wasn't happy with the course in first year, imagine how he would've reacted to the Ben
			fiasco)

		<p>
			Add some stuff with the advanced games engineering solo project (obviously make it better than
			the shite you handed in).
		</p><br>

		<p>
			Add some more shite with the advanced games engineering project with Jeremy Malisse and Steven
			Graham.
