	<br>
	<p>
		Artists, musicians/sound engineers, coders and general game enthusiasts from around the world unite to spend one entire
		weekend each year making small games. Every January, people take part in a 48-hour challenge in which
		they must create a game - either solo or in a team - relative to a theme announced at the start of the event.
		Once the theme has been announced, entrants engage in 48 hours of accelerated (rushed) game development. 
		Sleep is optional. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Global Game Jam is the world's largest event of its kind, and takes place in several physical locations around the globe,
		referred to as 'jam sites'. In my case, that is Edinburgh Napier University.

	<br>
	<p>
		Much like Global Game Jam, Ludum Dare - Latin for "to give a game" - is another long-running,
		largely popular accelerated game development event.
	</p>
	<p>
		This time however, creators can take up to 72 hours to make their game. That said, there is a more
		competitive version of the event whereby there are stricter rules to abide by, and only 48 hours in
		which to do so.
	</p>
	<p>
		These events run much the same way as GGJ does, but Ludum Dare isn't just an annual event; It takes
		place every April, August, and December.

				<p>
					Given a minimalistic project solution, we were tasked with creating a shoot 'em up game using
					SFML and C++. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The timeframe was a week, and the result was pretty pish.
				</p>
		</div>

				<h3><center>Advanced Games Engineering II</center></h3>
				<p>
					A poor group-working experience lead to an incomplete game that had initially showed
					good promise. I was hugely disappointed with the result, and so I took it upon myself to
					continue development in my spare time in a bid to keep the idea alive.
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea was to create a shoot 'em up style game, but with a twist. That twist was that
					after a set amount of time, the game would transform into a platformer after the player
					takes on a boss. Then, at the end of the platformer would be another boss battle. 
				</p>
				<p>
					After the module, the shoot 'em up stage wasn't even completed - even without a final boss.
					It was a real mess and became a scramble to tick boxes to earn marks for the coursework rather
					than being about what we wanted the game to be.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result, a lot of work needed to be done, but here is the final result!
				</p>

				<p>
					I'd never worked with an API, and I'd never worked with Python. Therefore, I decided 
					to work with an API using Python! 
				</p>
				<p>
					Actually, it was two APIs. I wrote (naw ye didny) an application to find out who tweeted
					a given set of keywords, or full sentence. 
				</p>
				<p>
					That way, when I decide to do a giveaway on my YouTube channel, I can tell people to get 
					creative with a set of keywords and try to make a funny sentence or tweet. Then, I'll find
					all of these tweets with my script, and enter their @handle into the prize draw! 

					<br>I'll probably automatically retweet and/or like them all too. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I also want to be able to see who has both liked and shared a facebook post announcing the
					giveaway. These people will also be entered into the draw. People with both twitter and facebook
					accounts will be able to enter the draw twice, or even more if they have multiple accounts.
				</p>
				<p>
					There's not really a lot I can do about that - but hey, it's more exposure for me :p

			Calum and I try to figure out the bug in our code and Kristian watches Caelan and tells us how
